This is the source code comprising my submission for the Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge in Kaggle. The code placed me in the top 39% of the challenge, which representing solving 2 of 104 tasks, however on the test and train sets it solved roughly 10%. The approach I took here was in-line with the approach the winner of the competition took (applying a DSL), only his was a lot more fleshed-out.

The [following workbook](https://www.kaggle.com/guyar1/interactive-notebook-not-plotting-arc-solutions) is an interactive implementation of the source code, which is probably the most accessable option for most people. This workbook also explains my approach in more detail. You will need to click "edit" in the workbook to access the code and then "run all" in the Notebook to run the code. Then scoll all the way to the bottom and click on the buttons to see how it did on the tasks.
